### If you would like the script to do everything for you:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatboyo/badbr0ker
cd badbr0ker
bash buildfull_badbr0ker.sh <board>
```
### If you would like to use a local recovery image:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatboyo/badbr0ker
cd badbr0ker
bash update_downloader.sh <board>
sudo ./build_badrecovery.sh -i image.bin -t unverified
```
### What is this?
badbr0ker is br0ker injected into badrecovery unverified, allowing for unenrollment on keyrolled kv5 ChromeOS devices.
### If you are on a [BadApple](https://github.com/applefritter-inc/BadApple) vulnernable device
Simply run the following in the shell, while connected to wifi:
```bash
curl -LO https://ba.crosbreaker.dev/br0ker.sh && sh br0ker.sh
```
### How do I make a usb?
Download a prebuilt from the [prebuilts section](#prebuilts), or build an image yourself with the above commands.  Flash it using the [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm), or anything else that etches disk images to USB drives. Such as [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), [dd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dd) or [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)
### I have a usb, what now?
Complete [sh1ttyOOBE](https://github.com/crosbreaker/sh1ttyOOBE), then enter developer mode and recover to your usb
### Prebuilts
[GitHub actions](https://nightly.link/crosbreaker/badbr0ker/actions/runs/19094111320)
### There is no prebuilt for my board!
Your device is either vulnerable to sh1mmer, or is extremely new (released after early 2025). If your device is too new, you unfortunately can't really do anything. However, if your device is vulnerable to sh1mmer, you can use [regular br0ker](https://github.com/ading2210/sh1mmer/releases/latest). This project is only meant for devices that are not vulnerable to the normal sh1mmer version of br0ker, and should never be used over that.
